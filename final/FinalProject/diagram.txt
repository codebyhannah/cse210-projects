Constructors:

Class : Card
Attributes:
* _number : int
* _suit : string
* _card : string
* _deck : string    // For games with multiple decks involved, so that it can be kept track of if needed.
* _serial : int    // Most useful for decks containing multiple of the same card, so it doesn't conflate them in methods such as Deck.Shuffle().
* _cardSymbols : List<List<string>>
* _suitSymbols : List<string>

Constructors:
* Card(number : int, suit : string, serial : int = 0, deck : string = "deck")    // Deck defaults to "deck" so that different values for deck can be used when needed and ignored if not. Serial defaults to zero for use in cases when it is not needed, such as when creating a single card for uses such as displaying the back of a card, which is created as its own Card object.

Getters and Setters:

Methods:

Class : Deck
Attributes:

* _deck : List<Card>
* _numJokers : int // Might be set anywhere from 0 to however many the game with the most jokers needs.
* _type : string    // Standard 52 vs. other variations such as the 48 card pinochle deck. Can also be set to "empty" in the constructor to generate an empty deck that will be added to as the game is played.
* _aesthetic : Aesthetic

Constructors:
* Deck(name : string, type : string = "empty", numJokers : int = 0)   // Defaults to set up an empty deck that will be added to as the game is played. The first option to be added here is the standard 52 deck as that deck is most commonly used in card games, but more options can be added in the future.

* Deal(numToDeal : int) : List<Card>    // Each card is removed from the _deck List<Card> attribute and added to a new list as it is "dealt", and the resulting list of Cards becomes the specified player's hand. Could use an if/else and iterate from 1 to 2 and back to deal cards one at a time back and forth between players with a timer to pause minutely between Cards, for effect.
* Draw(index : int = 0) : Card    // The Card is removed from the _deck and is then returned to be added to the player's hand or otherwise used/distributed.
